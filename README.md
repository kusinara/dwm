This build contains bad practices but should still be functional, I am also no longer using a tiling wm or Arch linux so I will not be working towards making a proper PKGBUILD with patches

## Patches
- vanitygaps
- swallow

## Bindings
- I use xbindkeys for bindings
- See config.def.h

## Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kusinara/st
$ cd dwm
$ sudo make clean install
```
